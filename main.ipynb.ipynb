He argues that there are no absolute values of good and evil, but rather these are adopted by individuals and societies as a way to maintain their place in the world or to become dominant. Nietzsche distinguishes between two types of morality: the first, which he calls noble-morality, is creative and active, leading to an ascent in the line of life. The second, slave-morality, is passive and defensive, focused on self-preservation. Nietzsche advocates for noble-morality, seeing it as conducive to growth and vitality, while criticizing Christian moral values as belonging to a lower type of morality.

One of the central themes is the concept of the \"Ubermensch\" or the \"Overman.\" Nietzsche presents the idea that humanity should strive to overcome its limitations and embrace a higher form of existence, transcending traditional moral and societal values. The Ubermensch is an individual who creates their own values and lives authentically, free from the constraints of herd mentality.\n\nAnother important idea in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' is the notion of eternal recurrence. Nietzsche suggests that life is a cyclical process, and every moment will recur infinitely. This idea challenges individuals to embrace the present moment fully and live their lives in a way that they would be willing to repeat for eternity.\n\nThe book also explores the idea of the death of God and the consequences of living in a post-religious world. Nietzsche suggests that the absence of a divine authority creates a void that humans must fill with their own values and meaning. This leads to a reevaluation of traditional moral values and an emphasis on individual freedom and self-creation.\n\n'Thus Spake Zarathustra' also delves into the nature of power and the will to power. Nietzsche argues that power is a fundamental driving force in human life, and individuals should embrace their desires and exert their will to power in order to live a fulfilling and authentic life.\n\nThese are just a few of the important ideas presented in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'. The book is rich with complex philosophical concepts and invites readers to question traditional beliefs and engage in a personal journey of self-discovery and self-transcendence.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = \"What life lessons does the book teaches?\"\nprint_response_for_query(query)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-18T07:41:59.599029Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-18T07:41:59.599468Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-18T07:42:19.470427Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-18T07:41:59.599433Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-18T07:42:19.469392Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n\n\u001b[1m> Entering new RetrievalQA chain...\u001b[0m\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"7721b13241474641941f55e08ab023a2"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"\n\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\nThe book 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' teaches several life lessons. One of the key lessons is the importance of self-overcoming and personal growth. Zarathustra encourages individuals to strive for self-improvement and to constantly challenge themselves in order to reach higher levels of existence. As he says, \"Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting\" (Chapter LXXVI).\n\nAnother important lesson is the rejection of societal norms and the pursuit of individual freedom. Zarathustra urges individuals to break free from the herd mentality and to embrace their individuality. He states, \"I beseech you, my brothers, remain true to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not\" (Chapter LXXVII).\n\nFurthermore, the book emphasizes the power of overcoming the three evil things: the spirit of gravity, the spirit of revenge, and the spirit of pity. Zarathustra teaches that these negative forces hinder personal growth and happiness. He advises, \"You must be proud of your enemies: then the successes of your enemies are also your successes\" (Chapter LIV).\n\nAdditionally, 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' explores the concept of culture and its impact on individuals. It questions the value of traditional cultural norms and encourages individuals to create their own values and meanings in life. As Zarathustra proclaims, \"I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome\" (Chapter XXXVI).\n\nLastly, the book deals with the ultimate questions of existence, spirituality, and the search for meaning. It presents a vision of a higher spiritual realm and encourages individuals to embrace the enigma of life. Zarathustra states, \"What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal\" (Chapter XLVI).\n\nIn summary, 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' teaches life lessons such as self-overcoming, individual freedom, overcoming negativity, questioning societal norms, and the pursuit of meaning and spirituality.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# To cleanup, you can delete the collection\nvectordb.delete_collection()\nvectordb.persist()\n\n# Or just nuke the persist directory\n!rm -rf db/","metadata":{},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Persisting DB to disk, putting it in the save folder db\n"}]}]}
