# LLM-QAwithLangChainonThusSpakeZarathustra
This repo is a question answering system that answers questions based on Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra.

# Overview

This project harnesses cutting-edge natural language processing technologies to build a conversational agent proficient in providing in-depth and philosophical responses to inquiries about Friedrich Nietzsche's work, "Thus Spake Zarathustra." The system integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for chat-based language modeling, LangChain for efficient text handling, Chroma Database for storing document embeddings, and SentenceTransformers for contextualized embeddings.

## Key Components

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - The system fetches the text of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" from Project Gutenberg, saving it locally using a web scraper, serving as the primary source for generating responses.

2. **Text Processing**
   - LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter divides the lengthy document into manageable chunks for improved handling and processing efficiency.

3. **Embeddings**
   - SentenceTransformers creates contextualized embeddings for processed text chunks, enhancing the model's understanding of content nuances.

4. **Conversation Memory**
   - A sophisticated memory mechanism using ConversationBufferMemory stores chat history, enabling the system to maintain context and deliver coherent responses.

5. **Retrieval-based Question Answering**
   - The RetrievalQA component integrates GPT-3.5-turbo as a language model and Chroma Database for efficient retrieval of relevant document embeddings. The model generates responses based on user questions, referencing both chat history and contextualized embeddings.

## Usage Example

Users can engage in philosophical discussions by posing questions related to Nietzsche's views. The system responds with insightful answers, incorporating quotes from "Thus Spake Zarathustra" to support its responses.

## Dependencies
